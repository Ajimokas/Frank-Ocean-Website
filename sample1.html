        <h2> Frank Ocean - Coachella 2023 </h2>
        <p> <a href="https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/coachella-co-founder-reconfirms-frank-ocean-will-be-headlining-in-2023/"> Article link</a> </p>
        <p> It's been almost 7 years since we've seen the legend perform.
            There are rumours creeping up that he'll be performing and headlining Cochella, like how cool is that??
            His last performace was in 2017 with the FYF fest and he's given us some snippets here and there like, the christmas special
            , "Come On World, You Can't Go" , it would be great to see him perform again at such a big event. 
            Read the excerpt below to learn more about his 2023 appearance!!
            Coachella co-founder Paul Tollett recently talked to LA Times 
            about Coachella 2022 including his decision to lift the mask 
            and vax mandates and Kanye West pulling out of the headliner spot before 
            confirming that Frank Ocean will be headlining in 2023.</p>

        <h2> Frank Ocean - Homer Launch </h2>
        <p> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7eae6d13-072a-4ae3-89a4-642fbf337bb9"> Article link</a> </p>
        <p> So we finally know why he was slient for so long, working really hard on his debut art project,
            Homer. We always knew he was into fashion and jewelry due to his luxury song names (Chanel, Comme Des garcons)
            but we didn't know he'd launch a full brand independent of blonded.co. Homer includes mostll fashion and jewelry (Diamonds too!!) We can't wait to see what's in store. 
            Plus, we know Frank is an ethical guy, as all of the artifacts in the store are lab grown. Unfortunately you must go in person in New York
            at 70-74 Bowery in ChinaTown, but we'd do anything for 
            Frank, wouldn't we? ;)
